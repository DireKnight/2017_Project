	<h4>there are number of way to create energy on our planet</h4>
   <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Geothermal energy is good option to create energy.Geothermal power plants 
            use steam to produce from reservoirs found below planet's surface.
        </p>
    <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
        <p>
            wind energy can be produce on our planet. wind used as mechanical power to perform tasks such as pumping water or grinding grain. 
            As the wind passes the turbines it moves the blades, which spins the shaft.
        </p>

	<h3>Remote Solar Energy</h3>
	<p>
	Using new advanced cutting-edge ultra hypersensitive solar harnessing technology, we can not only collect energy from the sun, but aslo from
	distant stars. This would require an array of next-generation solar harnessing satellites orbiting the planet, wirelessly transmitting the energy
	collected back to our planet. It would also require one giant, conventional, 'size-of-Russia' solar panel.

	<h4>Hamster Power</h4>
	<p>
	A new and upcoming form of energy creation. By employing an array of red-bull fueled hamsters running on wheels, we will be able to collect
	enough energy to power not one, but two planets.
