Plants will be grown in specialized greenhouses with built in oxygen generators to make up for the planets low oxygen content.

Basic List of food to grow:
- Potatoes
- Carrots
- White/Red Onions
- Beans
- Cabbage
- Garlic
- Wheat
- Corn
- Lettuce
- Tomatos

These crops we are growing well be suppleid actificial soil similair to Earths
add kept at consistent tempatures and hydration levels during there growth formaximum efficency.


Another soure of food for the colony would be fish farms since the planet is mostly water. These would consist of large tanks conacted the ocean that trap the fish in when population levels are low. While in the tank they are feed consistent amounts of food and alowed to grow.


Waste products from the residents will be used to fertilize the soil, as well as synthesized nurtient rich water that will be added via an automated watering system.


Crops will be genetically modified to grow larger and more nutrient rich, so that we can better feed the residents, with the least amount of space required for farming.
